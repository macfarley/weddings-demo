Here are **three clean, versatile wedding color stories** you can drop straight into a `styleguide.md` — each one tuned for a *cold‑spring Ohio wedding* vibe, where you might get anything from gray skies to soft sunlight to lingering winter chill. These palettes are intentionally flexible so you can theme the demo site around whichever direction the couple gravitates toward.

I kept them concise, hex‑ready, and easy to translate into Tailwind tokens later.
