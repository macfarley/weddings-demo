## 🌐 **Domain Strategy**
To keep costs predictable:

### **Year 1 (Wedding Year)**
- Couple receives a custom domain (e.g., `john-and-crystal.love`)  
- Cloudflare Email Routing handles:
  - `photos@domain`
  - `uploads@domain`

### **After Year 1**
Couple chooses:
1. **Renew the domain themselves**, or  
2. **Free archival hosting** at:  
   `sitesbymac.dev/weddings/johnandcrystal`

This keeps the site accessible without ongoing domain costs.

---

## 🚀 **Deployment**
This demo is deployed on **Vercel (Hobby tier)** — free, fast, and ideal for static wedding sites with light serverless usage.
